### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
My key takeaways are the further understanding of how GitHub works. This also served as a refresher in my ability to create and design my own portfolio using HTML and CSS. Aside from this, I was also able to think of what skills I have in certain departments, such as in communication and management. Most of all, I also learned the use flexboxes and how to modify them to best suit my preferences.
